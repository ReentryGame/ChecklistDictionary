# Checklist Dictionaries
This repo contains the checklist lookup files used in Reentry

Whenever a checklist is being executed in Reentry (by pressing RUN), a window appears where the checklist instructions are listed.
This list will automatically move forward as you progress with the checklist.

When a checklist is complete, the window is automatically hidden.

Each of the controls listed in the checklist has an ID and a friendly name. The ID is used to look up into the dictionaries in this repo, and a Display name will be rendered instead of the ID. This means that a change to the friendly name only has to happen in one place for all checklists to benefit. 

Right now, many Display Names are the same as the IDs.

The Display Name should show what panel the switch/control is in, and the name of it. For example:
- [MDC-1] GDC Align
- [MDC-2] EDS Auto

Any contributions are on a volunteer basis, and is freely given to the Reentry - An Orbital Simulator and Wilhelmsen Studios. If your contributions make it into the project, feel free to reach out on petriw@gmail.com and I will be happy to add you to the credits list.
