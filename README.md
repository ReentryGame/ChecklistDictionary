# Checklist Dictionaries
This repo contains the checklist lookup files used in Reentry

Whenever a checklist is being executed in Reentry (by pressing RUN), a window appears where the checklist instructions are listed.
This list will automatically move forward as you progress with the checklist.

When a checklist is complete, the window is automatically hidden.

Each of the controls listed in the checklist has an ID and a friendly name. The ID is used to look up into the dictionaries in this repo, and a Display name will be rendered instead of the ID.

Right now, many Display Names are the same as the IDs.

The Display Name should show what panel the switch/control is in, and the name of it.
